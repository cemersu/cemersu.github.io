Hi, I’m Ersu. Welcome to Ersu Labs.

Richard Feynman once said, "If you want to master something, teach it." This blog is built on that very foundation.

I am a student with a deep curiosity for the mathematical backbones of our world. Here, I explore the intricacies of Statistics and Artificial Intelligence.

Ersu's Lab is not just a showcase of what I know; it is the mechanism by which I learn. I take complex concepts, deconstruct them, and reconstruct them in a way that is intuitive and accessible. If I can explain it simply here, I know I’ve truly mastered it.

Whether you are here to learn something new or to correct my proofs, I’m glad you stopped by.

What to expect:

Deep dives into Probability and Statistics.

Explorations of Machine Learning algorithms.

Transparent documentation of my learning journey.

Let's deconstruct the universe, one equation at a time.
