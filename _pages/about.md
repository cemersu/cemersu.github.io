"Explorer of ideas with a strict adherence to lab ethics. I love the chaos of the unknown, but I tackle it with structure and discipline. My goal is simple: to keep learning, keep optimizing, and keep building things that matter. I don't just memorize concepts; I dismantle them to understand how they work. Currently focused on the intersection of AI and Neuroscience, aiming to become a little better every day."
